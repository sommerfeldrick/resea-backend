## ✅ Verification Checklist

After deployment:
- [ ] Got all 4 API keys
- [ ] Added to Render environment variables
- [ ] Redeployed backend
- [ ] `/api/ai/health` shows all providers available
- [ ] Can generate text with test request
- [ ] `/api/ai/stats` shows $0.00 cost

## 🎓 Key Concepts

### Quality Levels
- **`quality`**: Best for complex tasks (research, analysis)
- **`balanced`**: Default, good for most tasks
- **`fast`**: Best for simple, quick tasks

### Free Models
- **Gemini**: `gemini-2.0-flash-exp` (only option)
- **Groq**: `llama-3.1-70b-versatile` (quality) or `llama-3.1-8b-instruct` (fast)
- **OpenRouter**: Free Llama models with `:free` suffix
- **Ollama Cloud**: `mistral` (quality), `phi` (fast), `llama2` (balanced)

### How Fallback Works
1. Try Gemini → Success? Return ✓
2. Try Groq → Success? Return ✓
3. Try OpenRouter → Success? Return ✓
4. Try Ollama Cloud → Success? Return ✓
5. All failed? Return error (extremely unlikely)

## 🔐 Security Best Practices

✅ Store API keys in environment variables (never in code)
✅ Use separate keys for dev and production
✅ Rotate keys monthly
✅ Never commit `.env` files to Git
✅ Render masks environment values in dashboard

---

## 📞 Support

### Having Issues?
1. Check `RENDER_ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md` troubleshooting section
2. Verify all environment variables are set: `/api/ai/health`
3. Check Render logs in dashboard
4. Ensure API keys are valid
5. Try disabling providers one by one to isolate issue

### Need More Details?
- Model selection: `MODEL_SELECTION_STRATEGY.md`
- Deployment: `RENDER_ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md`
- Code changes: `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`
